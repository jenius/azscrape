          AzScrape
          %small A ruby wrapper for amazon product search

      %p
        %strong How to use:
        Just hit this page again with the url format /query/number_of_pages

      %p So, for example, this query:

      %pre http://azscrape.dev/ruby_on_rails/3

      %p ...would return 3 pages of amazon's results of a search for "ruby on rails". As you can see here, underscores are converted into spaces if necessary.
      
      %p The API currently will return the product title, author, image url, and amazon.com url.

      %p This is a super simple project, and if you would like it to return anything else or act in a different way, let me know or drop a pull request!

      %span.label.warning Warning
      %em The more pages you try to return, the slower it will load. I would very highly recommend not asking for more than 5 at a time - each page returns 18 results.
